# Second experiment: Replication Study



We carried out a strict internal replication of the baseline experiment [[link]](). The same experimental protocol was applied, but to a different population, meaning that we changed only the participants, while the site, experimenters, design, variables, and instrumentation remained the same. The purpose of this replication is to test the extent to which the study results could be generalized to other populations (i.e, a more homogeneous group of users). Strict replications are needed to increase confidence in the validity of the experimentâ€™s conclusion. An additional motivation is that the sample size of the baseline experiment can affect the magnitude of the effect (i.e. the strength of the relationship between the type of graphical menu and the UX measures of that population). Therefore, it is convenient to run internal replications to increase the sample size, thus improving the effectiveness of confirming the experiment hypotheses.


# Instrumentation

We used [Bitbrain's Diadem headset](https://www.bitbrain.com/neurotechnology-products/dry-eeg/diadem). The following image illustrates the headset and its electrode placement.

We represented the different graphical adaptive menus using an interactive slide presentation. Our menu representationswere based on two different domains: a mail manager software and a web browser.

For this experiment we used PowerPoint slides. We used a template and then generaded more pptx for each participants using a different menu order of use. This template can be downloaded [here](downloads/instrumentation/slides.ppts) (In Spanish)

After the experimental sesion, participants had to fill a questionnaire, which can be downlaoded [here](downloads/instrumentation/questionnaire.xlsm) (In Spanish)


# Data
